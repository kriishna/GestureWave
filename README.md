# GestureWave
This project is an Android application called GestureWave. Once downloaded and installed, it runs as a background service to the operating system and allows users to set custom gestures that use input from the proximity sensor and the accelerometer to interact with the operating system and with user applications without touching the screen. For example, a user running GestureWave can create a gesture that unlocks the screen just by the user waving his or her finger over the proximity sensor three times in quick succession. Other examples of gesture use could be to open other apps, control media playback, scroll web pages or documents, etc.
